        <p>I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I’m the second daughter of both parents who are technology journalists, and literature enthusiasts. I went to Film school and I while studying I was lucky enough to be trusted with important roles
          carrying out the Photography and Art Direction of multiple productions, first local and then international. In 2008 I decided to start my own venture, along with 3 other partners: <strong><a href="https://agencia.portinos.com/en/home-en/"
